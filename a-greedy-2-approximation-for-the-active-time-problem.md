# Brief Announcement: A Greedy 2 Approximation for the Active Time Problem

Brief Announcement: A Greedy 2 Approximation for the Active Time Problem, published in 2018 by Saurabh Kumar and Samir Khuller, seeks to see if a simple greedy solution to the active time problem can match the best established algorithm. They begin their paper by diving into the active time problem itself, formally defining it. After giving some important preliminaries, they continue by showcasing their greedy algorithm. With it, they provide an important theorem and three lemmas, and subsequently prove all of them mathematically. They prove their algorithm is a 2-approximation algorithm, and eventually show that it indeed matches the best-known approximation ratio for the active time problem. In the end, they state that the complexity status of the problem is still open, and propose using a local search technique for further studies.

In the end, I believe that this problem can in fact be applied in the real world, and the algorithm they found to answer it can be easy to implement for those without a strict theoretical computer science background. In addition, I do find interest in seeing where they take these results from here, as they mention the possibility of using a local search technique to further hone in on the best approximation.
